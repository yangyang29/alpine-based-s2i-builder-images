This is an running with 8u172-openjdk-alpine compiling with maven-3.5.3 responsible for consuming a JAVA MAVEN project
and deploying with apache-tomcat-8.5.32.
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image.

Sample invocation
s2i build git://github.com/example/openshift-tomcat-example sarcouy/s2itomcat:8.5-jdk8-mvn3.5.0 tomcattest

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run -p 8080:8080 tomcattest

Details:
The default Maven build arguments can be overridden by setting MAVEN_ARGS via the "--env" argument to S2I
default MAVEN_ARGS=package -Dmaven.test.skip=true.
The default Maven build arguments can be appended by setting MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND.
settings.xml can be defined via MAVEN_SETTINGS

If you set the "--env INCREMENTAL=true" to s2i, the sources are kept in the builded container
to deploy to allow a reuse of .m2 files, which is fast but the container can reach a size of bigger.
If you set the "--env INCREMENTAL=false" to s2i, the sources aren't kept in the builded container
to deploy, it allows a more lightweight container for releases, but longer to build.
-e INCREMENTAL has default value set to true (ready to use with --incremental)

In multi-module projects, you can decide which module to build by setting the "-e SELECTED_MODULE=xxxx"
